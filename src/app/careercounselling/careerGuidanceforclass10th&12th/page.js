          and most trending way of mapping a person's brain. In DMIT, the
          fingerprints of the client are taken using a scanner, and then a
          report is generated that gives complete details of the client's
          personality, strengths, weaknesses and potential. Research suggests
          85% accuracy for this approach. It is considered more effective than
          any psychometric test. Counselling done on the basis of fingerprint
          reports gives a clearer picture to the students to choose a career
          option based on their abilities and skill sets. In India, Brainwonders
          is the largest DMIT and career counselling centre, with 108 branches
          all across the country.`,
