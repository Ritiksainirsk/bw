            and most trending way of mapping a person's brain. In DMIT, the
            fingerprints of the client are taken using a scanner, and then a
            report is generated that gives complete details of the client's
            personality, strengths, weaknesses and potential. Research suggests
            85% accuracy for this approach. It is considered more effective than
            any psychometric test. Counselling done on the basis of fingerprint
            reports gives a clearer picture to the students to choose a career
            option based on their abilities and skill sets. In India, Brainwonders
            is the largest DMIT and career counselling centre, with 108 branches
            all across the country.`,
