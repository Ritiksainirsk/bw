              DMIT Dermatoglyphics Multiple Intelligence test (DMIT) is the
              latest and most trending way of mapping a person's brain. In DMIT,
              the fingerprints of the client are taken using a scanner, and then
              a report is generated that gives complete details of the client's
              personality, strengths, weaknesses, and potential. Research
              suggests 85% accuracy for this approach. It is considered more
              effective than any psychometric test. Counselling done on the
              basis of fingerprint reports gives a clearer picture to the
              students to choose a career option based on their abilities and
              skill sets. In India, Brainwonders is the largest DMIT and career
              counselling centre, with 108 branches all across the country.
