            The full form of DMIT is the Dermatoglyphics Multiple Intelligence Test (DMIT) is a biometric analysis based on the scientific study of fingerprints. It is useful for all age groups and helps understand an individualâ€™s potential, personality type, SWOT analysis, learning style, career introspection, and more. DMIT is particularly beneficial for parents and teachers, providing insights into a child's innate strengths and areas that need development. Using information from the child's biometrics, the DMIT assessment offers actionable insights and appropriate career recommendations.
